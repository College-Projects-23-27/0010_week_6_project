# 0010_week_6_project

## Overview
For this week's lab, we have to create a name repeater program. The program is a simple Python script that prompts a user to input a name and a number. The program will then output the name repeated the specified number of times.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.

## How to Run
1. Save the provided Python script into a file named `name_repeater.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `name_repeater.py` file.
4. Run the script using the command: `python name_repeater.py`.

## Usage
When you run the program, it will first prompt you to enter a name:

## Code Explanation
- The program starts by taking a name as input.
- Then, it prompts the user to enter a number. If the input is not a numeric value, the program will keep asking for a number.
- A `for` loop runs for the number of times specified, concatenating the name to a string with a space.
- The program then prints the string containing the repeated names.
